# 🎯 Customer Segmentation – Superstore Dataset

### 🔍 Overview
This project performs **customer segmentation** on the Superstore dataset using **RFM analysis** and **K-Means clustering**.  
The goal is to identify **high-value customer groups** and uncover actionable insights for **targeted engagement** and **retention strategies**.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Segment customers based on **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary value**  
- Apply **K-Means clustering** to identify meaningful customer groups  
- Visualise customer segments and purchasing behaviours using Python  
- Derive **data-driven marketing strategies** to improve retention and loyalty

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
| Tool / Library | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| **Python** | Core analytics and modeling |
| **Pandas, NumPy** | Data cleaning and feature engineering |
| **Matplotlib, Seaborn** | Data visualization and storytelling |
| **Scikit-learn** | K-Means clustering and preprocessing |

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned missing and inconsistent values  
   - Calculated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Standardised RFM values for clustering  

3. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - Determined optimal cluster count using Elbow method  
   - Assigned customer segments and interpreted behavioural patterns  

4. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Created intuitive visualisations of customer groups  
   - Analysed distribution of high-value vs low-value segments  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **High-value customers** showed high frequency and recency with strong revenue contributions  
- **Dormant customers** had long inactivity gaps, indicating potential churn risk  
- Suggested **targeted campaigns** for reactivation and loyalty-building  

---

## 🚀 Impact
- Enabled **data-driven segmentation** for smarter marketing decisions  
- Improved understanding of customer lifetime value and engagement potential  
- Showcased end-to-end analytical workflow from data prep to insight generation
